# 1) Load graph JSON
kg        <- fromJSON("data/MC1_graph.json")
nodes_tbl <- as_tibble(kg$nodes)
edges_tbl <- as_tibble(kg$links)

# 2) Build index map
id_map <- tibble(
  id    = nodes_tbl$id,
  index = seq_len(nrow(nodes_tbl))
)

# 3) Translate source/target → from/to
edges_tbl_graph <- edges_tbl %>%

## **🔗 Influence Analysis Panel**

**Section Purpose: Understanding Sailor Shift’s Artistic Influence Network**

This section presents a structured exploration of Sailor Shift’s artistic connections, using network analysis to examine three key perspectives:

1.  **Who has Sailor Shift been influenced by?**\

    Explore direct and indirect artistic influences on Sailor Shift over time.

2.  **Who has she collaborated with and influenced?**\

    Identify collaborators and assess how her work has directly or indirectly shaped others.

3.  **Her Influence on the Oceanus Folk Community**\

    Focus on how her influence has spread within the Oceanus Folk genre, including both direct and second-level indirect pathways.

![](images/clipboard-84853129.png)

The main dashboard will show into four parts **Interactive** **Filter Panel, Plot,** **Legend Panel,** **Interactive Data Table :**

1.  **Interactive** **Filter Panel :**

Objective : To empower users to efficiently explore and narrow down the influence network of Sailor Shift by providing intuitive and responsive filtering options.

Planned Filter Components & Intended Functionality

| Filter                                   | User Interaction                                              | Planned Purpose                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Select Node Type                         | Multi-select (e.g., Album, Person, Song, RecordLabel, etc.)   | Filters the network to show only selected entity types as nodes.                   |
| Search Node Name                         | Dropdown or typeahead search (e.g., "Brooke Olson")           | Focuses the network graph on the selected node, zooming in automatically.          |
| Select Edge Type                         | Multi-select (e.g., ComposerOf, Interpolates, etc.)           | Filters edges by relationship type to limit visual noise and highlight key links.  |
| Is Notable?                              | Radio buttons (All / TRUE / FALSE)                            | Filters nodes by whether they are tagged as “notable” to emphasize known artists.  |
| Select Genre(s)                          | Multi-select (e.g., Alternative Rock, Avant-Garde Folk, etc.) | Enables genre-based filtering to tailor the view to specific music categories.     |
| Release Year Range                       | Range slider (1983–2038) + "Select All Years" button          | Restricts nodes by their associated release year, helping with temporal filtering. |
| Select Network Depth (from Sailor Shift) | Range slider (1–3) + "Select All network" button              | Controls how many layers of influence (direct and indirect) are displayed.         |

Interaction Design Considerations

-   **Responsiveness**: Each filter is reactive and updates the network graph in real time.

-   **Performance Notices**: Informational messages are placed beneath heavier operations (e.g., select all years/network depth) to prepare the user for slight delays.

-   **Enhanced UX**: All dropdowns use searchable `pickerInput`s with “actions-box” for select/deselect all, streamlining multi-choice workflows.

2.**Planned Visualization Panel: Influence Plot & Summary Statistics and the related legends**

Objective

To dynamically visualize Sailor Shift's influence network and provide quantitative summaries that respond in real-time to user-selected filters.And Influence plot, we plan to use the network plot to see the influence and for the Statistics, we will use the bar chart.

Network Plot & Summary plan

|                    |                                            |                                                                                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Tab                | Content Type                               | Planned Interaction                                                                 |
| Influence Network  | Plan to use`visNetwork` graph              | Displays a dynamic node-link network showing direct and indirect influence.         |
|                    |                                            | Hover reveals details; click highlights sub-network.                                |
|                    |                                            | Responds in real time to filters in the left panel (node type, genre, years, etc.). |
| Summary Statistics | Plan to use `plotly` interactive bar chart | Shows count of edges by relationship type (e.g., ComposerOf, PerformerOf, etc.).    |
|                    |                                            | Aggregated metrics update live as filters change.                                   |

Propose outcome of the plots:

![](images/clipboard-3903768430.png)For the legends, we will also add some interactions into the summary bar chart to find more information for the audience and in order to make more clearly to understand the network, the legends will also show the node types and the edge types for references.

**3.Planned Table Panel: Influence Relationship Details**

Objective

To provide a tabular view of the filtered influence relationships, allowing users to explore details at a granular level, complementing the network graph.

Design & Features

Functionality plan:

-   **Paginated view** with adjustable row count (5, 10, 25, 50, 100)

-   **Search bar** for keyword-based filtering (e.g., node name, genre)

-   **Sortable columns** for customized sorting (e.g., by release year or relationship type)

Dynamic Interaction

-   Table will updates in real time based on all applied filters (e.g., node type, genre, year range).

-   Supports detailed exploration and verification of insights observed in the visual graph and summary statistics.

-   Plan to add downloadable CSV export or row click-to-expand options in the future.

Here are the propose skeleton of the first part of the network influence UI design.

Key Features 🎯 Filter by Genre Users can focus on a specific musical style to narrow the artist pool.

-   🎛 Customizable Score Weights Sliders allow users to adjust the importance of PageRank, Degree Centrality, Style Similarity, and Notable Works — helping tailor the talent score to different discovery goals.

-   📊 Radar Comparison Chart Visually compare up to 5 artists across the 4 scoring dimensions using an interactive radar plot.

-   📋 Scoreboard Table A sortable, downloadable table summarizing talent scores and ranking details.

-   📥 Export Results Allows users to download the scoring results as a CSV for further analysis or reporting.

📸 Talent Radar Panel![](images/clipboard-1923199072.png)

**Talent Radar – Score Explorer**

The **Score Explorer** tab in the Talent Radar module is organized into two main sections:

1.  **Artist Selection Controls (Left Pane)**
    -   **Filter by Genre**\
        Choose one or more music genres to limit which artists are considered.
    -   **Select Artists to Compare**\
        A searchable, multi-select dropdown that lists all artists active in the selected genre(s); up to five can be chosen for direct comparison.
2.  **Customize Score Weights (Left Pane)**
    -   **PageRank**\
        \> Indicates an artist’s global influence within the full network.
    -   **Degree Centrality**\
        \> Counts the number of direct connections an artist has (collaborations, samples, covers, etc.).
    -   **Style Similarity**\
        \> Reflects how frequently an artist contributes to works in the selected genre(s).
    -   **Notable Works Count**\
        \> The normalized count of an artist’s works flagged as “notable” in the dataset.
3.  **Visualization Output (Right Pane)**
    -   **Radar Comparison** (default)\
        Plots each selected artist on a four-axis radar chart (PageRank, Degree, StyleSim, NotableCount), scaled 0–1, making it easy to see which artist leads on which metric.
    -   **Scoreboard**\
        A sortable, searchable table of the raw normalized scores and overall weighted score for each selected artist.

This layout enables interactive “what-if” analysis: dragging the weight sliders immediately updates the radar and table, so stakeholders can experiment with different business priorities (e.g., favoring global influence vs. genre specialization) to surface the most promising emerging talent.

![](images/clipboard-736102350.png)

Talent Radar – Scoreboard

The **Scoreboard** tab complements the Radar Comparison by showing the underlying normalized metrics and overall weighted scores in a familiar table format. Key features:

-   **Entries Selector**\
    Control the number of rows shown per page (10, 25, 50, 100) for quick paging through results.
-   **Search Box**\
    Filter artists in real time by name or any score field.
-   **Sortable Columns**\
    Click any column header (PageRank, Degree, StyleSim, NotableCountNorm, Score) to sort ascending/descending.
-   **Download CSV**\
    Export the complete weighted scores dataset for offline analysis or reporting.
