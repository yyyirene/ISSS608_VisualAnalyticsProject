From the 2nd network depth:

Across the three visualizations of second-degree influence, we gain a nuanced understanding of how Sailor Shift’s artistry has been shaped by the broader musical landscape. The first two plots show that she draws inspiration from a diverse and layered mix of songs, albums, musical groups, and individuals, with influence types ranging from `InStyleOf` and `PerformerOf` to `CoverOf`, `InterpolatesFrom`, and `LyricistOf`. These edge types reveal her stylistic adaptability and lyrical depth, often engaging in reinterpretation and reimagination rather than imitation.

The third visualization, which focuses on notable nodes, highlights that many of Sailor Shift’s most impactful influences stem from high-profile works and creators. This suggests that her rise may be partially driven by alignment with established, reputable artists and their stylistic legacies. The density of notable nodes indicates that she has strategically positioned herself within a web of influential musical threads — absorbing, reworking, and echoing their signature styles.

Together, these visualizations depict Sailor Shift as not only a product of the Oceanus Folk genre but also a curator of its finest traditions, synthesizing both mainstream and niche influences into a sound that feels authentic yet elevated. Her indirect influences — passed through highly notable intermediaries — demonstrate how a rising artist can build cultural credibility while also innovating within tradition.
